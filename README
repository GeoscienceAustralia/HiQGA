Use run_image_regression.jl in > Julia 1.1.0 for a parallel version on, please remember to specify nchains before start, it takes about 139 seconds for 4001 parallel iterations on 4 cores, 398 seconds on 32 cores. Variable nchains controls the number of parallel workers.

Belatedly added a single process version on 03_oneprocess.jl, takes 113 s for
4001 iterations
