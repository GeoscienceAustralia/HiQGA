Use run_image_regression.jl in > Julia 1.1.0 for a parallel version, please remember to specify nchains before start, it takes about 139 seconds for 4001 parallel iterations on 4 cores, 398 seconds on 32 cores. Variable nchains controls the number of parallel workers.
 
Doesn't need MPI to run on your PC - simply comment out all lines starting with MPI in run_image_regression.jl to use Julia's in built parallelism. MPI is for use on a cluster with PBS that doesn't allow SSH communication between different nodes, should you choose to scale up your problem.
