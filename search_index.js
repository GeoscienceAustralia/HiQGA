Simply cd to the relevant example directory and include the .jl files in the order they are named. If using VSCode make sure to do Julia: Change to this Directory from the three dots menu on the top right. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler is configured to support parallel tempering on multiple CPUs - some of the examples accomplish this with Julia's built-in multiprocessing, and others use MPI in order to support inversions on HPC clusters that don't work with Julia's default SSH-based multiprocessing. The MPI examples require MPI.jl and MPIClusterManagers.jl, which are not installed as dependencies for this package, so you will need to ensure they are installed and configured correctly to run these examples. See here, below in the document for MPI on the NCI.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"HiQGA Documentation","title":"HiQGA Documentation","text":"Some example scripts have as a dependency Revise.jl as we're still actively developing this package, so you may need to install Revise if not already installed.

These gists were written originally for a package called transD_GP so you will have to modify using transD_GP to using HiQGA.transD_GP.
